            <h2>Friars prepare to honor 1998 NL champions</h2>    
            <p>Members of the Padres' 1998 National League Champion team will be in San Diego during the four-game weekend series against the Cardinals to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the second pennant in franchise history.
             But four key members of that record-setting team will sadly be missing. Third baseman Ken Caminiti died on Oct. 10, 2004. Hall of Fame batsman Tony Gwynn passed away on June 16, 2014, after a long battle with parotid cancer. Bench coach Rob Picciolo passed away suddenly this past Jan. 3. And 27 days after Picciolo passed away, general manager Kevin Towers died after a 14-month fight against anaplastic thyroid cancer.</p>

            <div id="aside"> <h2>Cordero en fuego</h2>
                <p>SAN DIEGO -- With every trip to the plate, Franchy Cordero looks more and more like a big league hitter and an integral piece in the Padres' future outfield.

                        On Thursday night, Cordero was just about the only hitter who could solve the Cardinals' pitching, pounding out three of his team's five hits.</p>
